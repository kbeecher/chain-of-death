# Wikidata and the Chain of Death

How close are you to history? A demonstration of how you can find out using Wikidata.

This simple HTML/JS page shows how Wikidata can show you how close you are to history. All you do is put your birthdate into the page, click 'Get predecessor', and Wikidata will find a random person from history who died on that date. Click it again and Wikidata will match that person's birthday with the deathday of someone else from history. And so on, and so on, building up a chain of death.

For a deeper discussion of the project, see my article on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/4k-byte-size/wikidata-and-the-chain-of-death-1ec310a18c8#.ifg6i7pci).
